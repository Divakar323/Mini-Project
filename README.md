Chatting web Application using React js
Teleconferencing or Chatting, is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas together despite of the geographical barriers. The technology has been available for years but the acceptance it was quit recent. Our project is an example of realtime chat application.

React.js was the most loved web framework by the developers worldwide because it helps us create the most engaging web apps efficiently and fast with minimal coding. In an attempt to witness this power we created a chat application using react.js and Firebase as backend

Our web chat app allows the users to send various types information like “text, video’s, image, emoji” it handles any unexpected error or exceptions by giving a pop up notification to users.

# CONCLUSION
The project Chat application using react js was completed successfully. There is always a room for improvements in any web based app. We achieved in connecting two individuals, one-to-one communication.There are several web based app which serves similar purpose as this project, but these web based apps were rather difficult to use and may provide complicated user interface which leads to difficult in figuring out, users interface should be easy and effective.This project main goal was to create a simple, secure web based chat application which can accessed on any device using browser and without having to install any application externally.
# FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
Our Chat application is made for connecting two individuals and allow them to chat personally share information we say that there’s some limitations which we have to follow inorder to achieve, with this note we can say that our chat application will not allow users to create groups or adding participants into a single group and sending a mass message to all users at a time future enhancement would be allowing users to create a group and chat also making a video call chats.
